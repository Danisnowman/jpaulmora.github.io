<p>Welcome to my awesome page on GitHub, here you'll be able to read about my current projects and their progress, or about whatever I'm into at the time of writting.</p>

<p>If you havent already, make sure to go check out <a href="https://github.com/JPaulMora/Pyrit">Pyrit</a> as I have been (slowly) updating it to current standards, any help or feedback is greatly apreciated.</p>
          
<p>My school project this year was Java-based, it basically consisted in a program a local store in school could use to manage credit given to students. The project is pretty simple, yet uses a lot of neat java things you may want to add to your own apps. Feel free to use any code found in <a href="https://github.com/JPaulMora/Proyecto-POO">here</a>.

<p>I am personally a deep learning fan, recently I discovered this simple, yet complete and cool project on this topic. Its about the 2048 game im sure you have played before, but this time watch how your computer learns to do it <a href="2048DL/2048.html">right on your screen</a>! 
</p>
          
<p>Even though I edited some code, I never got it to win, here's a challenge for you: beat me! (or my code)</p>

<p>Another machine-learning related project I've been working on is <a href="https://github.com/JPaulMora/IAMDinosaur">IAMDinosaur</a> which is a Nodejs neural network that learns to play Chrome's Dinosaur game.</p>
          
<p>Finally, with the previous projects we teach a computer how to interpret input to produce good output, but what happens when we ask a neural network what thinks is a good input? Google's trained image recognizing network was "used backwards" by changing its work from "tell us what's in this picture?" to "change this picture until it looks like something", this was called a Deep Dream! go check out how to make your own at <a href="https://github.com/google/deepdream/">Google's Deep Dream Project</a> to grab a copy of the source, or to <a href="deepdreamgenerator.com">this page</a> to make one using Google's AI.</p>
